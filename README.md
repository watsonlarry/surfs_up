# Surf's Up

## Overview
W. Avy (!) is opening an ice-cream and surf shop in Oahu. Mr. Avy's asked us to collect and parse historical weather data for the island so that he may better imagine the viability of his business. In this assesment we're looking at the weather data for the months of June and December. Let's see if we can draw and useful conclusions from the data!

### Results

**June temperatures:**

64°f, min

### Summary

The temperature differences between June and December look to be marginal. The data presents a pretty consistant temperature for Oahu year-round. There are not extreme differences in average temperatures between opposite seasons. If the people of Oahu like ice-cream & surfing in June, it stands to reason that they would enjoy it in December as well. To get fuller picture of Oahu's annual temperature profile, I might suggest inquiries into March and September's data. We'd have a picture of the island's temperature from each season of the year. This would help us to verify the temperature's stability throughout the year.
